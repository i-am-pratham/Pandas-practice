# üêº Pandas Practice: From Fundamentals to Mini-Projects

This repository documents my learning journey with **pandas**, the go-to Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that cover the core concepts of pandas, from basic DataFrame operations to more advanced techniques like feature extraction.

## üìñ What's Inside?

This repository is structured into two main parts:
1.  **Core Concepts:** Notebooks that cover fundamental pandas skills.
2.  **Mini-Projects:** Practical applications of these skills on real-world datasets.

### üöÄ Core Concepts Covered

These notebooks serve as my personal notes and practice files for the key functionalities in pandas.

* `DataFrame.ipynb`: Introduction to creating and understanding the structure of pandas DataFrames and Series.
* `Operations.ipynb`: Performing basic arithmetic, logical, and statistical operations on data.
* `Missing Data.ipynb`: Techniques for finding, removing, and imputing missing values (`NaN`).
* `GroupByagrregation.ipynb`: Mastering the powerful `groupby()` function for splitting data, applying functions, and combining results.
* `Merging, Joining , concatination.ipynb`: Methods for combining multiple DataFrames into a single one.
* `Pivot Tables.ipynb`: Reshaping and summarizing data for clearer insights using pivot tables.

### üìù Mini-Projects

Here, I've applied the concepts I learned to analyze a couple of interesting datasets.

#### 1. Global Country Analysis
* **Notebook:** `Countries.ipynb`
* **Dataset:** `Countries.csv`
* **Description:** An exploratory data analysis project where I cleaned and analyzed a comprehensive dataset of world countries.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, conditional filtering, grouping by continent/region, and calculating aggregate statistics (e.g., finding the most populous country in Africa).

#### 2. Anime Dataset Feature Extraction
* **Notebook:** `FeatureExtraction.ipynb`
* **Dataset:** `anime.csv`
* **Description:** A practical feature engineering task on a messy dataset of top-rated anime. The main challenge was to extract structured information from a single, messy text column.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Advanced string manipulation, using regular expressions (`regex`) to extract episode counts and release dates, and creating new, clean columns for better analysis.

### üóÇÔ∏è Datasets

* `Countries.csv`: A rich dataset containing demographic, economic, and health data for the world's nations.
* `anime.csv`: A list of top-rated anime from MyAnimeList.org, notable for its combined and unstructured `Title` column.
